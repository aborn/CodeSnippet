<h1>Conkeror Tutorial</h1>

<h3>Reading Key Notation</h3>

<p>
  The first thing you need to know about Conkeror is how to read key
  notation.  Each key combination is written as a hyphenated list of
  modifiers and key.  The codes for the common modifiers are as
  follows: <code class="key">C</code> means Control; <code class="key">M</code> means Meta or
  Alt; and <code class="key">S</code> means Shift.  Therefore the key combination
  <code class="key">C-M-f</code> means to hold down Control and Meta and press
  <code class="key">f</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The key to scroll down is <code class="key">C-n</code>.  The key to scroll up is
  <code class="key">C-p</code>
</p>

<p>
  Many commands in Conkeror are run by typing a sequence of two or
  more key combinations.  The notation is simple.  Each combination in
  the sequence is written, in order, separated by spaces.  The
  sequence <code class="key">C-h t</code> means to press Control-h, release all
  keys, then press <code class="key">t</code>.  <code class="key">C-h t</code> is the key
  sequence to view this tutorial.
</p>

<p>
  The key sequence to exit conkeror is <code class="key">C-x C-c</code>.
</p>

<p>
  <code class="key">C-g</code> is the abort key.  It is used to cancel a command
  from the minibuffer, or stop a web page from loading.
</p>

<p>
  <code class="key">Space</code> and <code class="key">Backspace</code> scroll a page down and
  a page up, respectfully.
</p>


<h3>Basic Navigation</h3>

<p>
  To browse to an URL in a new content buffer, type <code class="key">C-x
  C-f</code>.  This key sequence works from anywhere in Conkeror.
  Additionally, if you are already in a content buffer (as opposed to a
  buffer showing download progress or help), you can navigate the current
  buffer to a new url with the <code class="key">g</code> (find-url) key.
  The mnemonic is "go".  The key sequence <code class="key">C-x C-v</code>
  (find-alternate-url) is also available in content buffers.  It is
  identical to <code class="key">g</code> except that the prompt will be
  pre-filled with the current URL for you to edit.
</p>

<p>
  The <code class="key">B</code> key (note uppercase) is bound to
  the <code>back</code> command.  Practice basic navigation by
  typing <code class="key">g</code> and entering the text "about:" in
  the url prompt.  To come back to this tutorial from the about: page,
  type <code class="key">B</code>.
</p>


<h3>Hinting</h3>

<p>
  The system for interacting with the elements of a document is called
  the hinting system.  With the hinting system, you can do things like
  follow hyperlinks, copy URLs, focus form fields, and more.  Let's
  use the hinting system to follow a hyperlink.  You will receive
  instructions about how to return here after you follow the
  hyperlink.  If the numbered list and hyperlink following this
  paragraph are not in view, scroll so that they are.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Press <code class="key">f</code>.  (mnemonic: follow)</li>
  <li>The hyperlink should be hilighted, with a number on the left
  side.  Type that number and hit enter.</li>
</ol>


<a href="chrome://conkeror-help/content/back-forward.html">This is a
hyperlink.</a>

<p>
  As a matter of fact, in addition to following links by number, you can
  also follow them by a substring of the link text.  You could select the
  link above by typing <code class="key">f t h i s</code>.  When more than
  one link with similar text is in view, hinting will narrow down the
  choices as you type.  You can always specify the one you want by
  disambiguating the sequence with the hint number.
</p>

<p>
  But hinting is for more than just hyperlinks.  Conkeror provides
  several <em>hint classes</em> for operating on different types of
  elements.  The hint class is specified by typing the corresponding
  key sequence of the class before the key sequence of the command.
  It was not necessary to specify a hint class for following the
  hyperlink above because links are the default hint class for the
  follow command.  The following table lists the most common hint
  classes.
</p>

<table>
  <tr><td><em>key</em></td><td><em>hint class</em></td><td><em>mnemonic</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td><code class="key">n</code></td><td>links and form elements</td><td>li<b>n</b>k</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code class="key">i</code></td><td>images</td><td><b>i</b>mage</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code class="key">m</code></td><td>frameset frames and top window</td><td>fra<b>m</b>e</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code class="key">* *</code></td><td>dom nodes</td><td>wildcard</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  In the hinting system, hint number zero (0) is special.  It refers to the
  current URL in the buffer.
</p>

<p>
  The <code class="key">c</code> key is bound to the copy command.  Its
  default hint class is links.  To copy the URL of the page you are
  currently browsing, type <code class="key">c 0</code>.  To copy the url of
  a frame or iframe, type <code class="key">m c</code>.  If there is more
  than one frame visible, you will be prompted for a number, just as with
  hyperlinks.
</p>

<p>
  When none of the conventional hint classes cover the element that
  you want to operate on, you can use the dom-nodes hint class, to
  choose from among all visible dom nodes.  This hint class is bound
  to <code class="key">* *</code>.  Try copying the text of this
  paragraph now by typing <code class="key">* * c</code> followed by
  the hint number for this paragraph.
</p>


<h3>Finding Text (Isearch)</h3>
<p>
  <code class="key">C-s</code> invokes interactive text search mode, isearch
  for short.  <code class="key">C-r</code> invokes reverse isearch.  In this
  mode, just type the text you want to find into the minibuffer and Conkeror
  will search the document as you type.  To jump to the next match,
  hit <code class="key">C-s</code> again.  To jump to the previous match,
  hit <code class="key">C-r</code>.  To conclude your search,
  hit <code class="key">return</code>, or to abort it,
  press <code class="key">escape</code> or <code class="key">C-g</code>.  If
  you have previously concluded an isearch, you can use the
  keys <code class="key">S</code> and <code class="key">R</code> to jump to
  next and previous matches without going back into isearch mode.  This is
  called non-interactive resume.  To resume your last successful isearch in
  interactive mode, hit <code class="key">C-s</code>
  or <code class="key">C-r</code> twice.
</p>

<h3>Copying Text</h3>
<p>
  Apart from <code class="key">* * c</code> described above, there are other
  ways to copy text for times when what you want to copy does not neatly
  fill one dom node.  The process is straight-forward.  First, use isearch
  (<code class="key">C-s</code>) and search for the start of the text you
  want to copy.  When you have brought the search to the start of the text
  you want to copy, hit <code class="key">return</code> to conclude the
  search.  Although no cursor is visible, there is an invisible cursor where
  the search concluded.  Hold the <code class="key">shift</code> key and use
  the arrow keys to make a selection.  When you have selected the text you
  want to copy, release all keys and hit <code class="key">M-w</code> to
  copy the text to the clipboard.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Tip:</b> Although isearch is usually the quickest way to position the
  cursor, there are other ways.  One of them is to use the <em>focus
  link</em> browser-object command (<code class="key">n ;</code>).  When you
  focus a link, the invisible cursor will be left at the first character of
  the link text, and you can use shifted arrow keys to make a selection from
  that point.  If the methods outlined so far are unsuitable for a situation
  you encounter, then you can use <code>M-x caret-mode</code> to get a small
  but visible blinking cursor that you can move to where you need it.
  Call <code>M-x caret-mode</code> again to toggle it off.
</p>

<h3>What Next</h3>
<p>
  Now that you've completed the tutorial, you should have the basic skills
  to get around on the web.  But there is so much more to learn, and
  always the possibility of improving your efficiency through
  configuration.  Start by reading
  the <a href="http://conkeror.org/QuickStart">QuickStart</a>, and then
  explore the <a href="http://conkeror.org/">Conkeror Wiki</a> on your
  own.  Enjoy!
